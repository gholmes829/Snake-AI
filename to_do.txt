KNOWN BUGS
- doc strings on settings.txt for each evolution parsed incorrectly
- meta controller limited to depth=2 and #(TN)=3
- keyboard excpetion when training with multiproccessing can lead to looping exceptions
- keyboard exception when training may not join pools properly
- plotting chart unoptimized
- can crash when playing last game

FEATURES TO ADD
- testing
- add bash scripts to make ops more convenient (training, playing, resetting)
- add settings to visualize multiple snakes training at once
- potentially limit CPU core usage
- save most recent trained evolution to pause and resume training
- add battle mode
- generate graph post training
- diversification algorithm for initial training population

CHANGES
- change NN output to softmax, make activation functions modular

REFACTORING
- settings.py
- renamne trained models
- testing

OTHER
- add github documentation
- add html documentation
- add docstrings
- modify .gitignore to remove previously trained generations
- add requirements.txt  to use with PIP
