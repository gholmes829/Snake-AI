Note: almost all use cases work exactly as intended. Most bugs occur when closing windows in certain ways. Features to add are just new ideas and are not necessary. Items in other category should be done soon.

KNOWN BUGS
- doc strings on settings.txt for each evolution parsed incorrectly
- keyboard excpetion when training with multiproccessing can lead to looping exceptions
- keyboard exception when training may not join pools properly
- plotting chart unoptimized
- some saved models have incompatible architectures

FEATURES TO ADD
- testing
- command line args for script interface
- make hierarchical controller scalable
- add bash scripts to make ops more convenient (training, playing, resetting)
- add settings to visualize multiple snakes training at once
- potentially limit CPU core usage
- save most recent trained evolution to pause and resume training
- add battle mode
- generate evolution graph post training
- diversification algorithm for initial training population
- easier ability to train meta and hierarchical

CHANGES
- change NN output to softmax, make activation functions modular

REFACTORING
- settings.py
- renamne trained models
- testing

OTHER
- add github documentation
- add html documentation
- add docstrings
- modify .gitignore to remove previously trained generations
- add requirements.txt to use with PIP
