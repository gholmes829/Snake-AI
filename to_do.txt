KNOWN BUGS
- doc strings on settings.txt for each evolution parsed incorrectly
- keyboard excpetion when training with multiproccessing can lead to looping exceptions and may not join pools properly
- plotting chart unoptimized, should switch to built in animation

FEATURES TO ADD (MAYBE)
- command line args for script interface
- make hierarchical controller scalable
- add bash scripts to make ops more convenient (training, playing, resetting)
- add settings to visualize multiple snakes training at once
- potentially limit CPU core usage
- save most recent trained evolution to pause and resume training
- add battle mode
- generate evolution graph post training
- diversification algorithm for initial training population
- easier ability to train meta and hierarchical

MIGHT REFACTOR
- settings.py
- rename trained models

OTHER
- add html documentation
- add docstrings
